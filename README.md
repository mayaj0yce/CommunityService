I am a User and as a User I want to be able to visit a site where I can track my current pokedex.
When I visit this site I want to be able to store my current pokedex list
I want to be able to find information to help me complete my pokedex by showing information about a pokemon I don’t have - where to find it and how to catch it, etc.
